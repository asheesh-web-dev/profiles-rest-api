### **Git Branch Naming Conventions and Their Purpose**

#### 1. **Feature Branches (`feature/<issue-id>-<short-description>`)**  
   - **Purpose**: Used for **developing new features** or adding significant functionality to the application. This is where new functionality is added that doesn't yet exist in the main branch.
   - **When to use**: 
     - When you are adding a new feature or major enhancement.
     - The feature is **not yet in production** and should be developed **in isolation**.
   - **Example**: `feature/101-add-user-authentication`
     - **Explanation**: This branch is for implementing user authentication (e.g., login, signup).

#### 2. **Bugfix Branches (`bugfix/<issue-id>-<short-description>`)**  
   - **Purpose**: Used for fixing **bugs or issues** in the application that are found in the development or staging environment.
   - **When to use**:
     - When there is a **defect in the application** that needs to be fixed, and the fix does not change existing functionality dramatically.
     - It applies when an **existing feature** has stopped working or is causing issues.
   - **Example**: `bugfix/234-fix-login-error`
     - **Explanation**: This branch fixes an error occurring during the login process.

#### 3. **Hotfix Branches (`hotfix/<issue-id>-<short-description>`)**  
   - **Purpose**: Used for **critical bug fixes in production**. These are typically urgent issues that need immediate attention and a rapid deployment to production.
   - **When to use**: 
     - When there is a **critical issue in production** (e.g., app crashes, security vulnerability) that needs immediate resolution.
     - It typically happens outside of the usual release cycle.
   - **Example**: `hotfix/789-fix-crash-on-launch`
     - **Explanation**: The app crashes on launch in production, requiring an urgent fix.

#### 4. **Release Branches (`release/<version>`)**  
   - **Purpose**: Used for preparing a new **release version** of the software. This is where final adjustments, versioning, bug fixes, and documentation updates are made in preparation for a new release.
   - **When to use**: 
     - When a set of features is **complete** and you want to prepare it for deployment.
     - Use this branch to **finalize** the release by adding version numbers, performing last-minute bug fixes, and preparing release notes.
   - **Example**: `release/2.0.0`
     - **Explanation**: This branch is used to prepare for version `2.0.0` of the software, including minor bug fixes and final tweaks.

#### 5. **Experiment or Spike Branches (`experiment/<short-description>`)**  
   - **Purpose**: Used for **experimentation, prototyping**, or **spike solutions**. It allows developers to test new ideas, evaluate technologies, or experiment without affecting other branches.
   - **When to use**:
     - When testing a **new idea, prototype**, or **proof of concept**.
     - Typically a **short-lived branch**, discarded once the experiment is complete or the idea is validated.
   - **Example**: `experiment/test-new-db-schema`
     - **Explanation**: This branch is used to test a new database schema for performance improvements, which may or may not be used in the final application.

#### 6. **Support or Maintenance Branches (`support/<version>`)**  
   - **Purpose**: Used for **maintaining older versions** of the software, such as bug fixes or minor updates to a version that is still in production but not actively being developed.
   - **When to use**:
     - When you need to **support or patch older versions** of the software that are still running in production while newer versions are under development.
     - Typically used when clients or systems are still on legacy versions.
   - **Example**: `support/1.1.0`
     - **Explanation**: This branch is used to maintain and fix bugs in version `1.1.0` while the team works on version `2.0.0`.

### **Clarifying Differences Between Branch Types**  
To avoid confusion, let's clearly highlight the **differences between branch types** that might seem similar, like `bugfix` vs. `hotfix` or `feature` vs. `release`:

- **`feature`** vs. **`bugfix`**:
   - **Feature**: A new **addition** to the codebase (e.g., adding a login page).
   - **Bugfix**: A **correction** to an existing feature (e.g., fixing a broken login form).
   - **Key Difference**: **Feature branches** add new functionality, while **bugfix branches** solve issues with existing functionality.

- **`bugfix`** vs. **`hotfix`**:
   - **Bugfix**: Bugs found in **development** or **staging**, where fixes are deployed once the code is merged into `develop` or `main`.
   - **Hotfix**: A critical bug in **production** that needs immediate resolution, often outside the regular release cycle.
   - **Key Difference**: **Bugfixes** happen in the development process, while **hotfixes** address issues that are already in production.

- **`release`** vs. **`feature`**:
   - **Feature**: Used for **new functionality** that will eventually be released.
   - **Release**: Prepares code for a **production-ready release**. It’s for **finalizing** the version, not adding new features.
   - **Key Difference**: **Feature branches** are where new work happens, while **release branches** are about **stabilizing** and preparing a final version.

### **Git Commit Message Conventions**

Commit messages should be **consistent, clear**, and follow a simple format to maintain a clean project history. Here’s a structured approach for commit messages:

```

- **<type>**: Specifies the type of change (e.g., `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `chore`).
- **<scope>** (optional): Describes the area of the code affected (e.g., `auth`, `api`).
- **<short description>**: A concise summary of the change (50–72 characters).
